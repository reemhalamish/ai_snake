AI snake that chases your laser point

Usage:

download\clone the repository. Make sure to have a front-cam or a web-cam, as well as a laser and a projector.

Note that if two cameras (front and web) are being detected by the computer - it can happen when you use a laptop with a frontcam - you may need to change the camera id at thread_laser_capture.py to be 1 or 0, play with it to see for yourself :)

Run main.py (you will may need to download tkinter and numpy,  snake runs on python2).

At any point you can press 'q' to quit.

The first thing to run will be the calibration. 
To skip it press 's', 
to use the laser Aim the laser to thoses points at the projector (make sure the camera can see it!) 
and hold it steady, when at the same time press {this button}:

topleft  {1}
topright {2}
botleft  {3}
botright {4}

if you missed a capture, just repress the button.
When all four corners were detected the snake will take a couple of seconds to start. The screen will go black and then the screen will show the way that your camera sees the projector - you will see a grid of green and blue square(ish) shapes. Press 's' to start.

when the snake runs, you can press '+' and '-' to reduce and increase the miliseconds between frames, impacting snake speed.
